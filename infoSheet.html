			If you are under 18, Please show this to your parent/Guardian.
			</p>
			<p>
			You are invited to participate in a research study which has been authorised by the School of Technology at Nottingham Trent University. The researcher’s name is Matthew Smith (email: matthewjs@outlook.com), and is supervised by Dr Beverley Cook. The test case is titled "Usability of NFC".
			Feel free to play the game even even if you decide not to take part in this test case.
			</p>
			<p>
			This test case requires an Android or Windows phone, or tablet that has an NFC Reader and an internet connection. (NVA has guest Wi-Fi you may log into) If you do not own a capable device unfortunately you cannot take part.
			If you are unsure if your device can do this, try placing the device over one of the NFC tags in the museum. If your phone is capable, a message will appear on the screen.
			</p>
			<p>
			The test case consists of a game much like a scavenger hunt using NFC Technology (further explanation of the technology further down). This will be done by finding posters of videogame objects which contain NFC Tags. By holding your phone/tablet over the tags, your device will automatically attempt to scan them and be taken to the website containing the values of each tag.  If you find all of them you have completed the task, but you can choose to end before finding all of them. 
			Once you have finished or stopped the task, you will be able to fill out a questionnaire to receive the prize. During the test case the researcher may make observations and ask questions to do with the test case.
			The study consists of a test case in the form of a scavenger hunt. You will need to look for various videogame objects specified, and once found, scan the NFC tag with your phone/ smart tablet to receive a number for that specific code. 
			The purpose of the study is to investigate the usability of NFC technology; NFC is a technology that allows data transferring at very close range. For example, you could send a picture from one mobile phone to another if they are almost touching. Phones with the technology can also interact with “NFC Tags”. These store small amounts of information and holding a phone/ smart tablet close to them allows for things such as opening a webpage. This research is to find out if people want to see more of this technology in the future and how people use it, such as how quick people can scan the tags and how reliable they are.
			</p>
			<p>
			The data will be completely anonymous, so after submission It will be impossible to remove your result as it will not be linked to your person in anyway. The data will be used for a research project entitled “Usability of NFC”. This is part of the researcher’s final year project at Nottingham Trent University. It will be collected through observation and a questionnaire.
			By choosing to opt in, you are confirming that you have decided to volunteer as a research participant for this study. None of the data gathered is linked to you in anyway but if you decide not to take part or drop out, your results will be dismissed. Your results will only be used if you choose to opt in on the consent form, which is only avaialbe as a physical copy.
			If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to ask the investigator. 
			Thank you for your participation.
